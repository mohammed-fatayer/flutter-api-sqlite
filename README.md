Flutter API & SQLite Learning Project

Welcome to the Flutter API & SQLite Learning Project, a focused initiative to enhance your skills in Flutter framework, API integration, and SQLite database management. This project provides hands-on experience in combining these technologies to create a functional app.
Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Flutter app that demonstrates the integration of external data through API calls and the utilization of a local SQLite database for storage.
Learning Objectives

    API Integration: Learn how to make HTTP requests to fetch data from an API, and parse and display it in your Flutter app.

    SQLite Database: Gain insight into setting up and managing a local SQLite database in Flutter to store and retrieve data.

    State Management: Explore different state management techniques within Flutter for efficient app updates.

    User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface using Flutter's widgets to display API data and interact with the SQLite database.

    Error Handling: Implement error handling for network requests and database interactions.

Technical Highlights

    Flutter Framework: Develop the app using the Flutter framework, taking advantage of its UI components and hot reload feature.

    API Integration: Utilize Flutter's http package to make API calls and fetch data.

    SQLite Database: Set up SQLite database operations using the sqflite package for local data storage.

    State Management: Experiment with Flutter's state management options, such as Provider, GetX, or Bloc.

    UI Design: Design the app's user interface with Flutter widgets, creating a seamless user experience.
